            "Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--\n",

            "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\n",
            "and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\n",
            "without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\n",

            "away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\n",
            "and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\n",
            "her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\n",
            "that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\n",

eyes,\\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou?\", \"it said,\\nKnow'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever-enduring bards?\", 'And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.', \"Be it so, then I answer'd,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}\", \"In Cabin'd Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin'd ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\", \"Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean's poem.\", \"Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos'd I know not\\n    whither, yet ever full of faith,\\nConsort to
